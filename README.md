All the Java source classes will be found in the folder "/ForestFire/src/forestFire"

All the Matlab source codes will be found in the folder "Matlab". To generate plots, you need to open the files in Matlab

Two already compiled Java jar files will be found in the folder "jar files" (one is for GUI version and the other is for non-GUI version). Note that GUI version does not show any statistics. To run the jar files, you need to run the command "java -jar ForestFire.jar"

To compile the source code, we recommend jdk 1.8 as we used jdk 1.8 for our test purpose.

To switch from GUI version to non-GUI version, change the property value of "SHOW_GUI" to false in the Defs.java class

Defs.java class contains all the default values and constant values. There are notes for each parameters as comments in the Defs.java class.
